# ML-CVNS
> Machine Learning (ML) to automate detection of caravanserais (CVNS)

## Bases

### Learning base

- 60/80% of data tagged CVNS (examples)
- 40/20% of data tagged ‚åê CVNS (counter examples)
- 200/300 images
- 1 CVNS = 1 image
- image multispectral, multiscalar
- composed of images only, preferably in RAW (.gis) format
- number of pixels per image relatively the same from one image to another
- leave buffers (e.g. 10 m, 50 m)
